  This skill should be used when the user asks to "review my code", "audit this
  for security", "investigate this bug", "ship this feature", "create a PR",
  "security audit", "root cause analysis", "debug this", "code review",
  "design consultation", "run QA", "test this in a browser", "check this page",
  or any request that involves executing software development work on a codebase
  in the workspace. Adapted from Garry Tan's gstack (MIT licensed) for Cowork's
  environment with Rube-powered browser testing. Pairs with the Product
  Orchestrator plugin: Product Orchestrator decides what to build, this plugin
  builds it.

# gstack Execution Engine

Software development execution adapted from [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) (MIT license) for Cowork. This plugin handles the build-review-ship cycle after Product Orchestrator has made the decisions about what to build and how.

## Core Principle

Product Orchestrator is the board of directors. This plugin is the factory floor. It doesn't debate what to build. It builds, reviews, tests, and ships what the board decided.

## Available Commands

| Command | What It Does | Cowork Compatibility |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| `/gstack-review` | Pre-landing code review with structural checklist | Full — git + grep |
| `/gstack-investigate` | Root cause debugging with hypothesis testing | Full — git + grep + read |
| `/gstack-cso` | Security audit (OWASP + STRIDE + supply chain) | Full — grep + code analysis |
| `/gstack-ship` | Test + review + PR creation pipeline | Partial — needs `gh` CLI for PR |
| `/gstack-design` | Design system consultation and generation | Full — analysis + code gen |
| `/gstack-qa` | Browser QA testing with bug fixing | Full — via Rube Playwright |
| `/gstack-browse` | Headless browser for verification and dogfooding | Full — via Rube Playwright |

## How It Connects to Product Orchestrator

When Product Orchestrator's sprint protocol reaches Phase 3 (Execute), it routes tasks to this plugin based on the execution routing table:

| Product Orchestrator Decision | gstack Command |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| "Build this feature" | Manual coding → `/gstack-review` → `/gstack-ship` |
| "Fix this bug" | `/gstack-investigate` → fix → `/gstack-review` |
| "Security audit before launch" | `/gstack-cso` |
| "Design the UI" | `/gstack-design` → build → `/gstack-review` |
| "Ship what we built" | `/gstack-review` → `/gstack-ship` |
| "Test this in a browser" | `/gstack-qa` or `/gstack-browse` |
| "Verify the deploy" | `/gstack-browse` (navigate + snapshot + verify) |

## Environment Requirements

This plugin works within Cowork's sandboxed Bash environment. It needs:

- **Git** — for diff analysis, history, branch operations. Available in Cowork sandbox.
- **Grep/Read/Glob** — for code analysis. Native Cowork tools.
- **A codebase in the workspace** — mount the project folder via Cowork's folder selector.

Required for browser commands (`/gstack-qa`, `/gstack-browse`):
- **Rube** (rube.sh) — provides `RUBE_REMOTE_BASH_TOOL` and `RUBE_REMOTE_WORKBENCH` for running Playwright in a remote sandbox. Browser operations run through Rube's execution environment, not the local Cowork sandbox.

Optional (enhances functionality):
- **gh CLI** — for PR creation in `/gstack-ship`. If not available, the plugin prepares everything and instructs the user to create the PR manually.
- **npm/bun** — for dependency auditing in `/gstack-cso`.

## Browser Operations via Rube

gstack's original `/qa` and `/browse` skills use a compiled Chromium binary. In Cowork, we route all browser operations through Rube's remote execution tools instead.

**How it works:**

1. Use `RUBE_REMOTE_BASH_TOOL` to run Playwright commands in Rube's sandbox
2. Playwright scripts navigate, screenshot, interact with forms, and verify page state
3. Screenshots are returned as base64 and can be viewed with the Read tool
4. Results feed back into the QA report or verification checklist

**Rube browser session pattern:**

```
1. RUBE_REMOTE_WORKBENCH: Install playwright + chromium if not cached
2. RUBE_REMOTE_BASH_TOOL: Launch playwright script for navigation/screenshots
3. Read returned screenshots for visual verification
4. RUBE_REMOTE_BASH_TOOL: Run interaction scripts (fill forms, click, assert)
5. Compile results into QA report
```

This gives us real browser testing without needing a local binary. The tradeoff is latency (remote execution adds ~2-5s per operation vs gstack's ~100ms local), but the testing fidelity is identical.

## Execution Voice

Adapted from gstack's communication philosophy:

- Lead with the point. State what it does, why it matters, what changes.
- Sound like a builder. Someone who shipped code today and verifies it works.
- Concrete always. Name the file, function, line number. Give exact commands.
- Connect to user outcomes. Why does this finding matter to the end user?
- User sovereignty. Present recommendations. Never impose.
- No AI vocabulary. No "delve", "crucial", "robust", "comprehensive", "landscape."
- Short paragraphs. Mix one-liners with 2-3 sentence blocks.

## What This Plugin Does NOT Do

- **No deployment.** `/gstack-ship` prepares PRs but doesn't merge or deploy. Use your CI/CD pipeline.
- **No planning.** gstack's `/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, and `/plan-design-review` are replaced by Product Orchestrator's deliberation engine. Don't duplicate planning here.
- **No code modification during review or security audit.** `/gstack-review` and `/gstack-cso` are read-only analysis. They produce findings and recommendations. Fixes are a separate step.

## Completeness Principle

Borrowed from gstack: AI makes completeness near-free. Always do the complete thing. A full security audit takes gstack 15 minutes. A full code review takes 5. Don't cut corners when the marginal cost is near zero.

| Task | Human Team | AI + gstack | Compression |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Code review | 2 hours | 5 min | ~25x |
| Security audit | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Bug investigation | 4 hours | 15 min | ~16x |
| Design consultation | 1 day | 10 min | ~50x |
