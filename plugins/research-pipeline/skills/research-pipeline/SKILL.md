description: >
  Orchestrates the full research pipeline from topic to published article.
  Everything runs in Cowork — no external tools required. The natural starting point
  is a topic, not a file. Coordinates literature-discovery, citation-verifier,
  research-synthesizer, and content-writer skills. Manages the unified Supabase schema.
  Use this skill whenever the user says "run the research pipeline," "process my research,"
  "full research workflow," "start a new research project," "I want to research," "set up a
  new library," "research pipeline status," "what's the state of my research," or any
  request to orchestrate multiple research steps together. Also trigger when the user asks
  about the Supabase schema or scheduled research tasks.

# Research Pipeline Orchestrator

Coordinates the end-to-end research workflow entirely within Cowork.

## The Natural Flow

Most research starts with a question, not a file:

```
"I want to research STIG automation"
    │
    ▼
[1. Discover Literature]       ← search academic + industry + government sources
    │                             creates the library, finds initial sources
    ▼
[2. Verify Citations]          ← 4-layer verification on what was found
    │
    ▼
[3. Synthesize]                ← thematic map + writing perspective
    │
    ▼
[4. Write]                     ← Sorkin DOB narrative + MoxyWolf voice + voice injection
    │                             produces publication-ready article with bibliography
    ▼
[Google Drive + Supabase]      ← persisted, published, done
```

BibTeX import is available as an *alternative* entry point if the user already
has a collected bibliography. But discovery-first is the default path.

## Workflow: Starting from a Topic

### Step 1: Discover Literature

When a user says "I want to research [topic]":

Trigger the literature-discovery skill. It will:
1. Ask sharpening questions if the topic is vague
2. Create a new library in Supabase
3. Search across academic sources (OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, arXiv) AND
   non-academic sources (NIST docs, industry blogs, whitepapers, vendor docs)
4. Present candidates grouped by source type
5. Ingest the user's selections into the library

This single step gets the user from zero to a populated research library.

### Step 2: Verify Citations

Trigger the citation-verifier skill. It will:
1. Check all DOIs against CrossRef/DataCite
2. Verify arXiv IDs
3. Run semantic matching on abstracts
4. Score each citation's relevance to the library topic

Academic sources with DOIs will mostly pass. Non-academic sources (blogs,
whitepapers) will be marked as unverified but that's expected — they don't
have DOIs. The relevance scoring still applies to everything.

### Step 3: Expand (Optional)

After seeing the initial results, the user might want more:
- "Find more papers on [specific sub-topic]"
- "The gap in [area] needs filling"
- "Find the foundational papers on this"

Run discovery again with refined queries. The skill deduplicates against
what's already in the library automatically.

### Step 4: Synthesize

Trigger the research-synthesizer skill. It will:
1. Page through all citations and build a theme inventory
2. Generate a Mermaid thematic tree diagram
3. Walk through the perspective architect (writing angle, audience, sub-themes)
4. Persist everything to Google Drive and Supabase

## Workflow: Starting from a BibTeX File

If the user uploads a .bib file or says "import my BibTeX":

Trigger the import-bibtex skill. After import, the user can:
- "Verify my citations" → citation-verifier
- "Find more papers" → literature-discovery (to expand beyond what they had)
- "Synthesize my research" → research-synthesizer

## Workflow: Existing Library Maintenance

For libraries that already exist, any step runs independently:

- "I want to research [topic]" → discovery (creates new library)
- "Find more papers" → discovery (expands existing library)
- "Import my BibTeX" → import-bibtex
- "Verify my citations" → citation-verifier
- "Synthesize my research" → research-synthesizer
- "What's the state of my research?" → library stats

### Library Status

When asked about status, run `get_library_stats(library_id)` and present:

```
Research Library: [Name]
══════════════════════

Sources:  [total] total
  ├─ Academic papers:       [count]
  ├─ Government/standards:  [count]
  ├─ Industry/practitioner: [count]
  └─ BibTeX imports:        [count]

Verification:
  ├─ Verified:    [count] ([%])
  ├─ Failed:      [count] ([%])
  └─ Unverified:  [count] ([%])

With abstracts: [count] ([%])
Thematic Maps:  [count]
Perspectives:   [count]
Open Gaps:      [count]

Recommended Actions:
  [context-dependent suggestions]
```

## Supabase Schema

The unified schema lives at `references/supabase-migration.sql`. Key tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `research_libraries` | Named research projects |
| `citations` | All sources with verification status + embeddings |
| `thematic_maps` | Mermaid diagrams + theme inventories |
| `research_perspectives` | Writing angle / audience / sub-themes |
| `discovery_runs` | Literature search execution log |
| `research_gaps` | Identified coverage gaps |

Key functions:
- `read_library_citations()` — paginated reader
- `match_citations()` — semantic search across citations
- `get_library_stats()` — summary statistics

## Scheduled Tasks

### Weekly Literature Scan

```
/schedule — Weekly Literature Discovery (Sundays 8 AM)
For each active library, search for sources published in the last 7 days.
Stage candidates for user review. Never auto-ingest.
```

### Weekly Citation Verification

```
/schedule — Weekly Citation Verification (Sundays 9 AM)
For libraries with unverified citations, run the 4-layer verification.
Generate a summary report.
```

## Error Recovery

All operations are idempotent — safe to re-run. If a step fails:
- Check `discovery_runs` table for failed runs
- Check `verification_log` on individual citations for layer-specific failures
- If Supabase is unreachable, fall back to local file processing
