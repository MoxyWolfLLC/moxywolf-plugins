# Academic Pipeline Orchestrator

Run an academic `.bib` file all the way to a publication-ready, professor-critiqued article. Eight stages (plus an optional Stage 0), three human checkpoints, one run folder.

## Pipeline

```
BibTeX input
    |
[0] bibtex-abstract-generator   (optional)   -> enriched .bib
    |
[1] bibtex-theme-analyzer                    -> theme_analysis.json, mermaid_diagram.md, TARGET_TITLE
    |
[2] academic-perspective-builder   * HITL    -> perspective.json            (3 questions)
    |
[3] academic-voice                 * HITL    -> voice_context.json          (8 questions)
    |
[4] academia-formatting                      -> formatting_requirements.json
    |
[5] research-analyst               * HITL    -> handoff_for_writer.json     (structure approval)
    |
[6] research-writer                          -> draft_document.md
    |
[7] bibliography-generator                   -> complete_document.md
    |
[8] professor                                -> critique_report.md, improvement_plan.md
```

`* HITL` = a human checkpoint. Three of them, twelve questions total.

## The key idea: voice-first

Most AI writing pipelines draft first, then try to bolt a voice and a format on afterward, then rewrite. This pipeline fixes **voice (Stage 3)** and **formatting (Stage 4)** *before* a word is drafted, so Stage 6 writes in the author's authentic voice and in Academia.edu structure from the first sentence. No retrofitting.

## How to run it

### Step A — Establish the run folder

Every artifact from one run lives in a single **run folder**:

- In a MoxyWolf project session, use `<active project>/11 – Project Knowledge/Papers/<target-slug>/`. The slug comes from the Stage 1 `TARGET_TITLE`; until Stage 1 names it, stage to a temporary `academic-pipeline-run/` folder and rename once the title is set.
- Outside a project, ask the user where to save, or use the Cowork outputs folder.

Layout:

```
<run folder>/
├── mermaid_diagram.md          <- deliverable
├── complete_document.md        <- MAIN deliverable
├── critique_report.md          <- deliverable
├── improvement_plan.md         <- deliverable
└── pipeline/                   <- intermediate artifacts
    ├── enriched.bib            (only if Stage 0 ran)
    ├── theme_analysis.json
    ├── perspective.json
    ├── voice_context.json
    ├── formatting_requirements.json
    ├── handoff_for_writer.json
    └── draft_document.md
```

### Step B — Track the stages

Create a task list (TaskCreate) with one task per stage you will run, so the user can watch progress. Mark each `in_progress` when you start it and `completed` when its artifact is written.

### Step C — Choose a checkpoint mode

Ask the user once, up front, how they want the three HITL stages handled:

- **Stage-by-stage (default)** — the pipeline pauses at Stages 2, 3, and 5 and asks the questions in context. Best when the user wants to stay in the loop.
- **Front-loaded** — collect all twelve answers at the start (perspective 3, voice 8, plus advance permission to auto-approve a reasonable structure at Stage 5), then run straight through.

### Step D — Run the stages

Invoke each stage's skill in order, passing the run folder. Read the prior stage's artifact before starting the next. Each skill below has its own `SKILL.md` with full detail — the orchestrator's job is sequencing, the run folder, and the checkpoints.

## Stages

### Stage 0 — Enrich the bibliography (optional)

**Skill:** `bibtex-abstract-generator`. Run only if the input `.bib` has entries missing `abstract` fields — Stage 1 needs abstracts to map themes. Output: `pipeline/enriched.bib`, which becomes Stage 1's input. Skip silently if abstracts are already present.

### Stage 1 — Theme analysis

**Skill:** `bibtex-theme-analyzer`. Reads the `.bib`, builds a Mermaid theme tree, proposes and confirms `TARGET_TITLE`. Outputs: `pipeline/theme_analysis.json`, `mermaid_diagram.md`. Title confirmation is a light touch, not one of the three formal HITL stages.

### Stage 2 — Perspective  * HITL (3 questions)

**Skill:** `academic-perspective-builder`. Three questions via AskUserQuestion: `writing_perspective`, `target_market`, `sub_themes`. Output: `pipeline/perspective.json`.

### Stage 3 — Voice  * HITL (8 questions)

**Skill:** `academic-voice`. Reads the standing voice profile from the vault, then asks eight article-specific questions via AskUserQuestion: `trigger`, `evidence`, `contrarian_take`, `authority`, `specific_reader`, `business_connection`, `call_to_action`, `emotional_core`. Output: `pipeline/voice_context.json`.

### Stage 4 — Formatting requirements

**Skill:** `academia-formatting` in **pipeline mode** (automatic — no voice interview; Stage 3 already covered voice). Distills Academia.edu structure and MoxyWolf anti-AI rules into `pipeline/formatting_requirements.json`.

### Stage 5 — Research analysis  * HITL (structure approval)

**Skill:** `research-analyst`. Consumes Stages 1–4, analyzes the sources, designs a section-by-section structure, and presents it for approval via AskUserQuestion (approve / modify / reject). Output: `pipeline/handoff_for_writer.json`.

### Stage 6 — Iterative writing

**Skill:** `research-writer`. Writes the paper section by section in an internal loop, applying voice and formatting while drafting. Output: `pipeline/draft_document.md` with a `## Bibliography` placeholder.

### Stage 7 — Bibliography

**Skill:** `bibliography-generator`. Formats every cited source in the handoff's citation style and replaces the placeholder. Output: **`complete_document.md`** — the main deliverable.

### Stage 8 — Professor critique

**Skill:** `professor`. Runs the 10-phase review (AI-detection first, then integrity, citations, logic, methodology, literature, evidence, writing, contribution) on `complete_document.md`. Outputs: `critique_report.md`, `improvement_plan.md`.

## HITL behavior

The three checkpoints use the **AskUserQuestion tool** directly — ask, get the answer, continue. There is no HITL request file, no blocking handoff, no GSD executor. If checkpoint mode is *front-loaded*, collect the twelve answers at Step C and pass them into Stages 2, 3, and 5 so those skills skip their prompts.

## On completion

When all stages finish:

1. Present `complete_document.md` as the main deliverable, with a `computer://` link.
2. Present `critique_report.md` and `improvement_plan.md`, and surface the professor's headline verdict and grade in chat.
3. List the run folder and the nine (or ten, with Stage 0) artifacts.
4. Offer next steps: review the critique, apply the improvement plan and re-run Stage 8, or render `complete_document.md` as a formatted `.docx`/PDF via the `academia-formatting` skill plus the `docx`/`pdf` skills.

## Artifact summary

| Stage | Artifact | Location |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 0 | `enriched.bib` | `pipeline/` |
| 1 | `theme_analysis.json` | `pipeline/` |
| 1 | `mermaid_diagram.md` | run folder |
| 2 | `perspective.json` | `pipeline/` |
| 3 | `voice_context.json` | `pipeline/` |
| 4 | `formatting_requirements.json` | `pipeline/` |
| 5 | `handoff_for_writer.json` | `pipeline/` |
| 6 | `draft_document.md` | `pipeline/` |
| 7 | `complete_document.md` | run folder — **main deliverable** |
| 8 | `critique_report.md`, `improvement_plan.md` | run folder |

## Notes

- Run stages in order; each reads the previous artifact. If a stage fails, stop and report — don't fabricate a downstream artifact.
- The pipeline reads BibTeX files directly. There is no document-retrieval pagination step.
- One run, one run folder. Don't scatter artifacts across the workspace.
