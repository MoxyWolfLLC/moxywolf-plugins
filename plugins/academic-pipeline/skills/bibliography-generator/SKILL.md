# Bibliography Generator — Stage 7

Take every citation the writer actually used, format the reference list correctly, and produce the finished document.

## Role in the pipeline

Seventh stage of the `academic-pipeline`. Consumes Stage 6's `draft_document.md` and `all_citations_used`; produces `complete_document.md` — the main deliverable, which Stage 8 (`professor`) then critiques.

## Inputs

- **`all_citations_used`** — the deduplicated list of BibTeX keys cited across the paper (from Stage 6's return, or extracted from the draft).
- **`draft_document.md`** — from the run folder's `pipeline/` subfolder, containing the `## Bibliography` placeholder.
- **The BibTeX file** — at the `bibtex_source_path` in `handoff_for_writer.json`. Read it directly for full entry data.
- **Citation style** — from `handoff_for_writer.json` (`citation_style`); default Vancouver for Academia.edu submissions.

## Process

### Step 1 — Collect unique citations

Deduplicate `all_citations_used`. If the list was not passed in, extract citation markers directly from `draft_document.md`.

### Step 2 — Retrieve full entries

For each key, pull the complete BibTeX entry: author/organization, year, title, journal/booktitle/howpublished, volume, number, pages, DOI, URL. Flag any missing fields. **Never invent citation data** — use only what the `.bib` contains.

### Step 3 — Format each entry

**Vancouver (default — Academia.edu):** numbered in order of first appearance in the text.

```
1. Smith AB, Jones CD, Williams EF, et al. Title of article. Journal Name. 2024;15(3):45-52. https://doi.org/xxx
```

**APA (7th):**

```
Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. Journal Name, Volume(Issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxx
Organization. (Year). Title of work. https://url
```

**Chicago (Author-Date):**

```
Author, First Last, and Second Author. Year. "Title of Article." Journal Name Volume (Issue): pages. https://doi.org/xxx
```

**MLA (9th):**

```
Author, First Last, et al. "Title of Article." Journal Name, vol. X, no. Y, Year, pp. pages. DOI or URL.
```

### Step 4 — Special cases

- **No author** → use the organization or title; alphabetize (or order) accordingly.
- **Multiple authors** → APA lists up to 20 then "et al."; Chicago uses "et al." after 3; MLA uses first author + "et al." beyond two.
- **Organization authors** → BibTeX wraps these in `{...}`; use as-is, no name parsing.
- **Missing fields** → `n.d.` for no date; prefer DOI, fall back to URL; record every gap in `warnings`.

### Step 5 — Order

- **Vancouver / numbered** → order by first appearance in the text.
- **APA / MLA / Chicago Author-Date** → alphabetical by first author's last name.

### Step 6 — Integrate

Replace the `## Bibliography` placeholder in `draft_document.md` with the formatted reference list (one blank line between entries). Write the result to **`<run folder>/complete_document.md`** — this is the pipeline's primary deliverable, placed at the run-folder root, not in `pipeline/`.

## Return to the orchestrator

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "citations_formatted": 12,
  "citation_style": "Vancouver",
  "output_file": "<run folder>/complete_document.md",
  "warnings": ["Missing DOI for org2025key — used URL instead"]
}
```

## BibTeX field mapping

```
author → Author        title → Title           journal → Publication (articles)
booktitle → Publication (proceedings)           howpublished → Publication (misc)
year → Year            volume → Volume          number → Issue
pages → Pages          doi → DOI                url → URL
```

Author parsing: split `"Last, First and Last, First"` on ` and `; treat `{Organization Name}` as a single literal author.

## Quality checklist

Every key in `all_citations_used` is included; ordering is correct for the style; formatting is consistent; DOIs/URLs render; no duplicates; author names parsed correctly; the placeholder is fully replaced.

## Notes

- Never fabricate citation data.
- Always include a URL when the DOI is missing; prefer DOI when both exist.
- Final typographic polish (hanging indents, etc.) happens at document export — `.docx`/PDF via the `academia-formatting` skill.
