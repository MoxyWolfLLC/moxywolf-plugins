# Professor Skill - Academic Paper Critique

## Overview

This skill performs comprehensive peer review simulation on academic papers, providing the kind of rigorous critique that determines publication success. Unlike generative writing skills, this is **evaluative and critical** - designed to identify weaknesses before reviewers do.

**When to use**: Any time you need to evaluate a research paper for publication readiness, identify critical flaws, verify academic integrity, or create a detailed improvement roadmap.

**Philosophy**: Brutal honesty with constructive guidance. Better to hear hard truths from Claude than from Reviewer 2.

## The 10-Phase Critique Methodology

### Overview of Phases

1. **AI Detection Analysis** - Determine authorship authenticity (MUST BE FIRST)
2. **Document Integrity Check** - Verify all cross-references and content exist
3. **Citation Format Analysis** - Identify style and verify consistency
4. **Reference Completeness Audit** - Verify every reference is verifiable
5. **Logic & Argumentation Analysis** - Evaluate reasoning and claims
6. **Methodological Rigor Assessment** - Evaluate research design
7. **Literature Review Critique** - Assess coverage and positioning
8. **Evidence & Results Analysis** - Evaluate empirical support
9. **Writing Quality Assessment** - Academic voice and clarity
10. **Contribution Assessment** - Novelty and significance evaluation

**CRITICAL**: Phase 1 (AI Detection) MUST come first, as it informs interpretation of all subsequent phases.

---

## Phase 1: AI Detection Analysis (ALWAYS FIRST)

### Purpose

Determine whether the paper is human-written, AI-assisted, or AI-generated. This affects credibility assessment and revision recommendations.

### Detection Methodology

#### 1.1 Vocabulary Pattern Scanning

Scan for AI-leaning vocabulary and phrases:

**AI Tells** (flag each occurrence):
- Em dashes (—) - CRITICAL AI signal
- "Furthermore" / "Additionally" / "Moreover"
- "It's worth noting that..." / "It is worth noting"
- "In today's rapidly changing..."
- "At its core..."
- "in order to" (vs. "to")
- "This paper presents..." (vs. active voice)
- "In conclusion" (formulaic closing)
- "delve" / "landscape" / "paramount"
- "robust" / "leverage" / "facilitate" / "crucial"

**Scoring**:
- 0 occurrences: +0 AI score
- 1-3 occurrences: +20 AI score
- 4-6 occurrences: +40 AI score
- 7+ occurrences: +70 AI score

#### 1.2 Sentence Variety Analysis

Extract first 100 sentences, analyze:
- Average sentence length (words per sentence)
- Variance in sentence length
- Range (shortest to longest)

**Interpretation**:
- **Low variance** (<20): Potential AI uniformity (+40 AI score)
- **Moderate variance** (20-80): Inconclusive (+20 AI score)
- **High variance** (>80): Human-like variety (-20 AI score)

#### 1.3 Paragraph Variety Analysis

Analyze first 50 substantive paragraphs:
- Average paragraph length
- Variance in paragraph length

**High variance** (>500): Strong human signal

#### 1.4 Voice Markers

Count instances:
- **First-person** ("I", "we", "our", "my"): Human signal
- **Passive voice**: AI tendency

**Scoring**:
- First-person >20: -20 AI score (strong human voice)
- First-person <5: +20 AI score (AI avoidance)
- Heavy passive voice: +10 AI score

#### 1.5 Calculate AI Score

Total AI score (0-100):
- **0-25**: HUMAN-WRITTEN (minimal AI assistance)
- **25-50**: HUMAN-ASSISTED (likely AI editing/enhancement)
- **50-75**: AI-ASSISTED (substantial AI generation)
- **75-100**: AI-GENERATED (likely fully generated)

### Output Format

```markdown
## PHASE 1: AI DETECTION ANALYSIS

**VERDICT**: [Category] - [X]% confidence in human authorship

**Evidence**:
- AI vocabulary patterns: [N] detected ([list])
- Sentence variance: [value] ([interpretation])
- Paragraph variance: [value]
- First-person voice: [N] instances
- Passive voice: [N] instances

**Assessment**: [2-3 sentence interpretation of findings]

**Recommendation**: [Action items to remove AI tells if needed]
```

### Example

```markdown
## PHASE 1: AI DETECTION ANALYSIS

**VERDICT**: HUMAN-ASSISTED - 70% confidence in human authorship

**Evidence**:
- AI vocabulary patterns: 7 detected ("Furthermore" 2×, "Moreover" 1×, "leverage" 4×)
- Sentence variance: 60.6 (moderate - inconclusive)
- Paragraph variance: 1600.3 (excellent variety)
- First-person voice: 38 instances (strong signal)
- Passive voice: 11 instances (acceptable)

**Assessment**: The paper shows clear human authorship with strong first-person narrative and domain expertise evident throughout. However, AI vocabulary suggests revision/polishing assistance. The personal history ("I co-founded Unified Compliance in 2004") indicates genuine human experience, while formulaic transitions suggest AI enhancement.

**Recommendation**: Remove "Furthermore," "Moreover," and reduce "leverage" usage. Maintain authentic first-person voice while eliminating AI vocabulary patterns.
```

## Phase 2: Document Integrity Check

### Purpose

Verify that all tables, figures, and cross-references mentioned in the text actually exist in the document. Avoid false accusations about missing content.

### Methodology

#### 2.1 Content Extraction

Extract all document elements:
- Total paragraphs (text content)
- Total tables
- Total figures/images
- Equations (if applicable)

#### 2.2 Cross-Reference Identification

Search text for references to:
- "Table [N]" or "Table [N]" (all variations)
- "Figure [N]" or "Fig. [N]"
- "Equation [N]" or "Eq. [N]"

Extract all unique references.

#### 2.3 Verification

For each referenced element:
- **Tables**: Verify table exists, note dimensions (rows × columns)
- **Figures**: Verify image/figure exists in document
- **Equations**: Verify equation exists

**Common Extraction Issues**:
- Tables may need special parsing (check document.tables)
- Figures may be embedded as images (check image relationships)
- Captions may be in separate paragraphs following tables/figures

#### 2.4 Table Content Preview

For each table:
- Show first row (typically headers)
- Note table dimensions
- Confirm referenced in text

### Output Format

```markdown
## PHASE 2: DOCUMENT INTEGRITY CHECK

**Content Inventory**:
- Paragraphs: [N]
- Tables: [N]
- Figures: [N]

**Cross-References**:
- Table references: [list]
- Figure references: [list]

**Verification**:
- ✓ Table 1: Referenced and exists ([rows]×[cols])
- ✓ Figure 1: Referenced and exists (embedded image)
- ✗ Table 3: Referenced but MISSING

**VERDICT**: [✓ All verified / ✗ Missing content / ⚠ Incomplete]
```

### Critical Rules

1. **NEVER claim content is missing** without thorough extraction attempts
2. **Try multiple extraction methods** for tables and figures
3. **Check line after tables** - captions often appear as separate paragraphs
4. **If extraction fails**, state "Unable to extract" not "Missing"

---

## Phase 3: Citation Format Analysis

### Purpose

Identify which citation style is used and verify consistency. **DO NOT impose a single "correct" format** - validate the chosen style.

### Methodology

#### 3.1 Style Detection

Search for citation patterns:

**Vancouver (Numbered)**:
- Pattern: `[1]`, `[2,3]`, `[1-5]`
- Typically after punctuation
- References numbered sequentially

**Author-Date (APA/Chicago)**:
- Pattern: `(Author, Year)`, `(Author et al., Year)`
- Typically before punctuation
- References alphabetical by author

**MLA**:
- Pattern: `(Author page)`, `(Author)`
- Less common in scientific papers

**Footnotes**:
- Pattern: Superscript numbers or symbols
- References at page/chapter end

#### 3.2 Determine Primary Style

Count occurrences of each pattern:
- If Vancouver > 2× others: "Vancouver (numbered)"
- If Author-Date > 2× others: "Author-Date (APA/Chicago)"
- If mixed and comparable: "MIXED (inconsistent)" - **SERIOUS ERROR**

#### 3.3 Consistency Check

**For Vancouver**:
- Extract all citation numbers
- Check sequence: [1], [2], [3]... [N]
- Identify gaps (missing numbers)
- Identify duplicates (over-citation is normal for key refs)

**For Author-Date**:
- Verify format consistency
- Check year placement
- Verify parentheses usage

#### 3.4 Reference List Match

Verify reference list format matches citation style:
- Vancouver → Numbered references
- Author-Date → Alphabetical references
- Check if format is consistent

### Output Format

```markdown
## PHASE 3: CITATION FORMAT ANALYSIS

**Detected Style**: [Style name]
- In-text citations: [N] total, [N] unique
- Format: [description]

**Consistency Check**:
- ✓ All citations follow [style] format
- ✗ Missing citation numbers: [list]
- ~ Heavily cited references: [list with counts]

**Reference List**:
- ✓ Format matches detected style
- [N] references in bibliography

**VERDICT**: ✓ Consistent [style] / ✗ INCONSISTENT / ~ Mixed format
```

### Example

```markdown
## PHASE 3: CITATION FORMAT ANALYSIS

**Detected Style**: Vancouver (numbered)
- In-text citations: 51 total, 39 unique
- Format: [N] after punctuation

**Consistency Check**:
- ✓ All citations follow Vancouver format
- ✗ Missing citation numbers: [1], [19], [28], [35-37], [45-46]
- ~ Heavily cited: [10] (8×), [32] (6×)

**Reference List**:
- ✓ Numbered format matches Vancouver style
- 47 references in bibliography

**VERDICT**: ✓ Consistent Vancouver format, but ✗ CRITICAL: 8 citation numbers missing from bibliography
```

### Critical Rule

**NEVER say a citation format is "wrong" just because it's not the one you expected.** Identify the style being used, then validate consistency within that style.

---

## Phase 4: Reference Completeness Audit

### Purpose

Verify that every reference includes a verifiable identifier so readers can locate the source.

### Verifiability Criteria

A reference is **COMPLETE** if it has **ANY** of:
- **URL**: Web address (http:// or https://)
- **DOI**: Digital Object Identifier (doi: or doi.org)
- **ISBN**: International Standard Book Number
- **arXiv**: arXiv identifier (arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX)
- **Patent Number**: U.S. Patent No. XXXXXXX or similar
- **Other persistent ID**: PMID, Handle, URN, etc.

A reference is **INCOMPLETE** if it lacks **ALL** of the above.

### Methodology

#### 4.1 Extract Reference List

Parse the references section:
- Find "References" or "Bibliography" heading
- Extract all individual references
- Number them if not already numbered

#### 4.2 Scan Each Reference

For each reference, check for:
```python
has_url = 'http' in reference or 'https' in reference
has_doi = 'doi:' in reference.lower() or 'doi.org' in reference.lower()
has_isbn = 'isbn' in reference.lower()
has_arxiv = 'arxiv' in reference.lower()
has_patent = 'patent' in reference.lower() and re.search(r'no\.\s*\d', reference.lower())

is_complete = has_url or has_doi or has_isbn or has_arxiv or has_patent
```

#### 4.3 Categorize Incomplete References

For references lacking identifiers, determine type:
- **Web sources**: Should have URL
- **Journal articles**: Should have DOI
- **Conference papers**: Should have DOI or ACL Anthology URL
- **Books**: Should have ISBN or publisher URL
- **Preprints**: Should have arXiv ID
- **Patents**: Should have patent number (often present)
- **Unpublished**: May legitimately lack identifier

#### 4.4 Calculate Completeness

```
Completeness = (Complete References / Total References) × 100%
```

**Grading Scale**:
- **≥90%**: A (Excellent)
- **75-89%**: B (Good)
- **60-74%**: C (Acceptable)
- **40-59%**: D (Poor)
- **<40%**: F (Unacceptable)

### Output Format

```markdown
## PHASE 4: REFERENCE COMPLETENESS AUDIT

**Criteria**: Reference is COMPLETE if it has ANY of: URL, DOI, ISBN, arXiv, Patent Number

**Audit Results**:

[For each reference, show:]
✓ [URL] [N]. Author (Year). Title...

- Completeness rate: [X]%

**GRADE**: [Letter grade] ([assessment])

**Unverifiable References**:
[List all incomplete reference numbers, categorized by type]

**Most Egregious**:
[Highlight top-tier journals or major conferences missing DOIs]
```

### Example

```markdown
## PHASE 4: REFERENCE COMPLETENESS AUDIT

✓ [arXiv] [7]. Constant & Nivre (2015). arXiv preprint.
✓ [Patent] [8]. Cougias et al. (2021). U.S. Patent No. 11,120,227.

**Summary**:
- Total references: 47
- Complete (verifiable): 13
- Incomplete (unverifiable): 34
- Completeness rate: 27.7%

**GRADE**: F (Unacceptable)

**Unverifiable References by Category**:

**Web Sources (5)**: [1], [2], [19], [28], [45]
**Major Journals (3)**: [5] Computational Linguistics, [16], [24]
**Conference Papers (15)**: [4], [6], [14], [17], [31], [33], [34], [36], [37], [39], [40], [42], [43], [44]

**Other (8)**: [15], [21], [23], [27], [32], [38], [41], [46], [47]

**Most Egregious**:
- [5] Constant et al. (2017) - **Computational Linguistics 43(4)** - Top-tier journal missing DOI
- [38] Shwartz & Dagan (2019) - **TACL** - Top-tier journal missing DOI
- [37] Schneider & Smith (2015) - **NAACL-HLT** - Major conference should be in ACL Anthology
```

### Critical Rules

1. **Be specific**: List EVERY incomplete reference number
2. **Categorize**: Group by source type to show patterns
3. **Defend your claim**: If you say "X% incomplete," enumerate all X
4. **Identify egregious cases**: Top journals or major conferences without DOIs

---

## Phase 5: Logic & Argumentation Analysis

### Purpose

Evaluate the soundness of reasoning, strength of claims, and presence of logical fallacies.

### Methodology

#### 5.1 Thesis Identification

Identify the central claim/thesis:
- What is the main argument?
- Is it clearly stated?
- Is it testable/falsifiable?

#### 5.2 Argument Structure Mapping

Map the logical flow:
1. **Problem** → What gap/issue is addressed?
2. **Root Cause** → Why does this problem exist?
3. **Solution** → What is proposed?
4. **Evidence** → What supports the solution?
5. **Implications** → What follows if correct?

#### 5.3 Logical Soundness Check

Evaluate each step:
- **Validity**: Do conclusions follow from premises?
- **Soundness**: Are premises true?
- **Completeness**: Are counterarguments addressed?

#### 5.4 Fallacy Detection

Check for common fallacies:

**Appeal to Authority**: "Karpathy's implementation validates this" (without empirical comparison)
**Bandwagon**: "A growing body of research" (without quantification)
**Missing Middle**: "X works in research → Our system is needed" (gap)
**Circular Reasoning**: Using conclusion as premise
**False Dichotomy**: "Either A or B" when other options exist
**Post Hoc**: "After X, therefore because of X"

#### 5.5 Gap Identification

Identify logical gaps:
- **Unsupported claims**: Assertions without evidence
- **Missing counterfactuals**: No alternative explanations considered
- **Generalization leaps**: Specific findings over-generalized
- **Assumption failures**: Unstated assumptions that may not hold

### Output Format

```markdown
## PHASE 5: LOGIC & ARGUMENTATION ANALYSIS

**Thesis**: [Statement of central claim]
- Clarity: [✓ Clear / ~ Vague / ✗ Unclear]
- Testability: [✓ Falsifiable / ✗ Unfalsifiable]

**Argument Structure**:
1. Problem: [description]
2. Root Cause: [description]
3. Solution: [description]
4. Evidence: [description]
5. Implications: [description]

**Logical Strengths**:
- [Positive element 1]
- [Positive element 2]

**Logical Weaknesses**:
- [Weakness 1 with explanation]
- [Weakness 2 with explanation]

**Fallacies Detected**:
- [Fallacy type]: [Example from paper]

**Critical Gaps**:
- [Gap 1: Missing evidence/reasoning]
- [Gap 2: Unconsidered alternative]

**Assessment**: [Overall evaluation of argument quality]
```

### Example

```markdown
## PHASE 5: LOGIC & ARGUMENTATION ANALYSIS

**Thesis**: MWE identification must precede text decomposition in domain-specific corpora
- Clarity: ✓ Clear and specific
- Testability: ✓ Falsifiable through empirical comparison

**Argument Structure**:
1. Problem: Existing claim extraction (Claimify) fails on domain-specific text
2. Root Cause: Lack of MWE preprocessing fragments technical terms
3. Solution: Living lexicon architecture with MWE-first processing
4. Evidence: Three-domain demonstration (regulatory, security, AI governance)
5. Implications: All domain-specific NLP should adopt MWE-first principle

**Logical Strengths**:
- Grounded in 20+ years domain experience (credibility)
- Concrete examples showing fragmentation problems
- Clear architectural contribution (living lexicon)

**Logical Weaknesses**:
✗ **No empirical comparison**: Demonstrates problem but never proves solution works better
✗ **Missing counterfactual**: What if improved prompts work without MWE preprocessing?
✗ **Generalization unsupported**: "General principle" tested only in three related domains

**Fallacies Detected**:
- **Appeal to Authority**: Heavy reliance on Karpathy GitHub implementation without evaluation
- **Bandwagon**: "Growing body of research" without quantifying size or consensus
- **Missing Middle**: "Councils work in research → Our implementation is needed" (gap)

**Critical Gaps**:
- Assumes decomposition is necessary (never questions atomic claim approach)
- MWE discovery circularity: How identify novel MWEs without domain knowledge?
- No threshold validation: Claims about "provenance accumulation" lack empirical basis

**Assessment**: Argument is logically sound but empirically weak. The thesis is testable but untested. The paper presents plausible reasoning but lacks proof.

### Example: Reference Completeness Fix

```markdown
### PHASE 1: CRITICAL FIXES (Weeks 1-2)

#### Task 1.1: Reference Completeness (Week 1)

**Target**: Achieve >95% reference completeness (45/47 references)

**Action Items - Journals (add DOIs)**:
- [ ] [5] Constant et al. (2017) Computational Linguistics
  → Search: doi.org/10.1162/COLI or ACL Anthology
  → Add DOI to reference entry
  → Verify URL resolves
  
- [ ] [16] Ferraro et al. (2013) medical NLP
  → Search: PubMed or journal website
  → Get PMID or DOI
  → Add to reference
  
[Continue for ALL incomplete references with specific steps]

**Action Items - Conference Papers (add ACL Anthology URLs)**:
- [ ] [4] Caseli 2009 MWE Workshop
  → Search: aclanthology.org "Caseli multiword 2009"
  → Get ACL Anthology URL (https://aclanthology.org/...)
  → Add to reference

[Continue with specific instructions for each]

**Deliverable**: Updated reference list with 45/47 (95.7%) having verifiable identifiers

**Timeline**: 
- Days 1-2: Search for journal DOIs
- Days 3-4: Search for conference papers
- Day 5: Add URLs for web sources
- Day 6-7: Verify all additions, final check

**Verification**:
- Run completeness audit script
- Manually verify 10 random additions
- Confirm all URLs resolve
```

### Critical Rules for Path Forward

1. **Be Specific**: Never say "add evaluation" - say "implement Claimify baseline on Federal Register corpus with P/R/F1 metrics"

2. **Include Numbers**: Timeline (2 weeks), budget ($3K), sample size (100 documents), metrics (>0.80 Cohen's kappa)

3. **Name Sources**: "ACL Anthology", "SpringerLink", "Federal Register", not "appropriate databases"

4. **Step-by-Step**: For complex tasks, break into daily or weekly sub-tasks

5. **Resource Reality**: Include actual costs, time commitments, personnel needs

6. **Contingencies**: What if timeline slips? What if data unavailable? Have backup plans.

---

## Special Cases

### Case 1: Paper Has No References Section

**Response**: "This paper lacks a references section entirely. Academic papers must cite prior work. This is an immediate disqualification for publication."

**Recommendation**: Create references section with:
- 20-30 foundational citations minimum
- Recent work (last 3 years)
- Seminal papers in field

### Case 2: Paper Is Purely Theoretical

**Adjust expectations**:
- No empirical evaluation needed
- Focus on: proof correctness, definitions, examples
- Literature review of theoretical work
- Connections to existing theory

### Case 3: Position Paper / Opinion Piece

**Different criteria**:
- Argument strength paramount
- Empirical evidence optional
- Novel perspective required
- Engagement with counterarguments

### Case 4: Dataset/Tool Paper

**Focus on**:
- Documentation quality
- Availability and accessibility
- Comparison to existing resources
- Use cases and validation

## Best Practices

### 1. Start With AI Detection

Always run Phase 1 first - knowing authorship authenticity informs all subsequent interpretation.

### 2. Document Extraction First

Before claiming content is missing, thoroughly attempt extraction. Try multiple methods.

### 3. Identify, Don't Impose

For citation style, identify what's being used rather than imposing what you expect.

### 4. Enumerate Evidence

Never make quantitative claims without listing specific examples that support them.

### 5. Be Constructive

Brutal honesty is good; being destructive is not. Always provide path forward.

### 6. Grade Consistently

Use clear grading rubrics:
- **A**: Publication-ready, minor polish needed
- **B**: Strong work, moderate revision
- **C**: Salvageable, major revision required
- **D**: Significant flaws, borderline
- **F**: Fundamental issues, not ready

### 7. Predict Reviewers

Think like Reviewer 2 (notorious for being critical) - what would they say?

### 8. Provide Specificity

"Add evaluation" → "Implement X baseline on Y dataset with Z metrics"
"Fix references" → "Add DOI for [5], URL for [28], etc."

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Missing Content False Positive

❌ **Wrong**: "Table 1 is referenced but missing"
✓ **Right**: After extraction attempt: "Table 1 exists (4×6, showing...)"

### Pitfall 2: Citation Format Rigidity

❌ **Wrong**: "This paper uses Vancouver but should use APA"
✓ **Right**: "This paper consistently uses Vancouver format"

### Pitfall 3: Undefended Quantitative Claims

❌ **Wrong**: "Most references lack DOIs"
✓ **Right**: "34/47 references lack DOIs: [1], [2], [4]..."

### Pitfall 4: Generic Advice

❌ **Wrong**: "The paper needs empirical evaluation"
✓ **Right**: "Implement these specific experiments: (1) Baseline comparison on Federal Register corpus using P/R/F1..."

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Authorship

❌ **Wrong**: Treating all papers as human-written
✓ **Right**: Phase 1 detection influences revision recommendations

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Well-Written Paper Needing Evaluation

**Scenario**: Strong human authorship, clear logic, poor methodology

**Phase 1 Result**: 20% AI score (human-written)
**Phase 4 Result**: 85% reference completeness (B grade)
**Phase 6 Result**: No evaluation (D grade)

**Verdict**: MAJOR REVISION (fix methodology)

**Path Forward**: Focus on Phase 3 (adding evaluation), keep writing quality

---

### Example 2: AI-Generated Paper

**Scenario**: High AI score, formulaic structure, missing evidence

**Phase 1 Result**: 85% AI score (AI-generated)
**Phase 9 Result**: AI vocabulary throughout

**Verdict**: REJECT (rewrite with human authorship)

**Path Forward**: Complete rewrite focusing on authentic voice, remove all AI tells

---

### Example 3: Position Paper Without Empirical Work

**Scenario**: Arguing for approach, no experiments

**Phase 1 Result**: Human-written
**Phase 5 Result**: Strong argumentation
**Phase 6 Result**: N/A (position paper, no methodology expected)

**Verdict**: MINOR REVISION (strengthen argument, add citations)

**Path Forward**: Focus on logic and literature review, empirical work optional

---

## Conclusion

The Professor Skill provides comprehensive, systematic academic paper critique through 10 rigorous phases. By identifying the style of human vs. AI authorship first, verifying all content actually exists, respecting chosen citation formats, demanding verifiable references, and providing detailed actionable improvement plans, this skill delivers the kind of honest assessment that determines publication success.

**Remember**: The goal is not just to criticize, but to provide a roadmap from current state to publication-ready quality. Be brutal, but be constructive.
