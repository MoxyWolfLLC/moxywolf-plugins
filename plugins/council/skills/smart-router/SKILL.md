  This skill decides whether a user's question warrants full multi-model

  based on learned patterns from past deliberation outcomes stored in
  pattern memory. Triggers automatically before every deliberation when
  routing is enabled via /council-config. Uses heuristic fallbacks when
  pattern memory has insufficient data, and learned rules once 20+

# Smart Router

Decide whether a query should go through full Council deliberation or be answered by a single model. The router starts conservative (deliberate on everything), applies heuristics for early routing, and transitions to learned rules once pattern memory has enough data.

## Routing Decision Flow

                  └── If no confident match → DELIBERATE (exploration — learn from outcome)
```

## Step 1: Extract Query Features

Parse the incoming query and produce a features object. This is done once here and passed through the entire pipeline (deliberation-engine uses it for logging, pattern-memory stores it).

```json
{
  "length": 87,
  "category": "architecture_decision",
  "keywords": ["compare", "tradeoffs"],
  "complexity_signals": {
    "sub_question_count": 2,
    "has_conditional": false,
    "has_context_reference": true,
    "has_compound_conjunction": true
  },
  "estimated_protocol": "voting"
}
```

**Category classification** — apply the rules from `references/routing-heuristics.md`:

| Category | Primary keywords | Protocol |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| `architecture_decision` | compare, tradeoffs, pros cons, architecture, design pattern, migration | voting |
| `compliance_security` | STIG, CMMC, compliance, FedRAMP, NIST, audit, security, risk | consensus |
| `code_implementation` | implement, code, function, bug, error, fix, test, deploy, API | voting |
| `strategy_business` | strategy, market, pricing, positioning, competitor, growth, roadmap | voting |
| `creative_writing` | write, draft, blog, post, article, copy, headline, narrative | voting |
| `factual_lookup` | what is, define, how does, explain, meaning of, syntax for | consensus |
| `other` | No strong signal match | voting |

**Compound query detection** — look for conjunctions (and, but, or, vs, versus, compared to) joining distinct sub-questions. Compound queries lean toward deliberation regardless of category.

**Protocol selection** — reasoning queries get voting, knowledge queries get consensus. If the query is compound with mixed types, default to voting (larger accuracy gain).

## Step 2: Check Pattern Memory

Read `council-memory.json` from the workspace.

- **File not found:** Proceed to Step 3 (heuristic routing). Set `routing_source: "heuristic_no_memory"`.
- **File found, `deliberations.length` < 20:** Proceed to Step 3. Set `routing_source: "heuristic_learning"`. Include progress note: "Learning: {N}/20 deliberations logged."
- **File found, `deliberations.length` >= 20, `routing_model.rules` is empty:** Proceed to Step 3. Log a suggestion: "20+ deliberations logged — run `/council-config rebuild-router` to activate learned routing."
- **File found, `routing_model.rules` has entries:** Proceed to Step 4 (learned routing).

## Step 3: Heuristic Routing (Fallback)

Apply hard-coded rules when pattern memory is insufficient. These are intentionally conservative — they lean toward deliberation for ambiguous cases because every deliberation generates training data for the learned router.

**Decision table (evaluated top to bottom, first match wins):**

| Priority | Condition | Decision | Confidence | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Budget setting < $0.03 | `single_model` | 0.95 | Budget too low for deliberation |
| 2 | Query length < 20 chars | `single_model` | 0.7 | Too terse for meaningful deliberation |
| 3 | Category is `factual_lookup` AND no compound conjunctions | `single_model` | 0.75 | Simple factual — one model suffices |
| 4 | Category is `code_implementation` AND no decision keywords | `single_model` | 0.65 | Deterministic code task — deliberation unlikely to add value |
| 5 | Keywords include "compare", "tradeoffs", "pros and cons" | `deliberate` | 0.9 | Explicit comparison request |
| 6 | Keywords include "should I", "which is better", "best approach" | `deliberate` | 0.85 | Decision query |
| 7 | Query length > 100 AND sub_question_count >= 2 | `deliberate` | 0.8 | Complex multi-part query |
| 8 | Category is `architecture_decision` or `strategy_business` | `deliberate` | 0.8 | High-stakes reasoning |
| 9 | Category is `compliance_security` | `deliberate` | 0.8 | Accuracy-critical domain |
| 10 | Category is `creative_writing` | `deliberate` | 0.7 | Benefits from diverse perspectives |
| 11 | (no match — catchall) | `deliberate` | 0.5 | Uncertain — deliberate to learn |

**Model selection for single-model routing:** When heuristic routing decides `single_model`, select the preferred model:

- `factual_lookup` → Use the Analyst model (default: `openai/gpt-4o`)
- `code_implementation` → Use the Analyst model
- Budget-constrained → Use the cheapest model in the lineup (check `references/model-configs.md` cost table)
- All other single-model routes → Use the Strategist model (default: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`) as the general-purpose best performer

## Step 4: Learned Routing

When pattern memory has 20+ deliberations and the routing model has been built, use data-driven rules.

**4a. Match query category against rules.**

Read `routing_model.rules` from the memory file. Each rule has:

```json
{
  "condition": "category == 'architecture_decision'",
  "action": "deliberate",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "sample_count": 8,
  "value_score": 0.78,
  "preferred_model": null
}
```

Find all rules where the condition matches the extracted query features. If multiple rules match (e.g., category match + keyword match), use the one with the highest confidence.

**4b. Apply confidence thresholds.**

| Rule confidence | Behavior |
|----------------|----------|
| > 0.8 | Follow the rule. High certainty. |
| 0.5 – 0.8 | Follow the rule but flag in output: `"uncertain": true`. The deliberation-engine should note this in the output so the user knows the router is still learning this pattern. |
| < 0.5 | Ignore the rule — default to deliberation. This is an exploration case; the outcome will strengthen or weaken the rule. |

**4c. Dynamic model selection.**

When the routing decision is `deliberate`, the router also recommends which models to include based on `model_performance.category_ranks`:

1. Read `model_performance` from the memory file
2. For the query's category, look up each model's average rank in `category_ranks`
3. **Exclude models that consistently underperform:** If a model's average rank in this category is >= 3.5 (out of 4), exclude it from the lineup and substitute the next-best available model from the large lineup (see `model-configs.md`)
4. **Promote strong performers:** If a model's average rank in this category is <= 1.3, recommend it as chairman pre-favorite (it will likely win peer review anyway, but this saves the user from seeing a predictable peer review)
5. Minimum 3 models for any deliberation — never exclude below this floor
6. Return the recommended lineup in `recommended_models`

When the routing decision is `single_model`:

1. Check if there's a `preferred_model` on the matched rule
2. If yes, use it
3. If no, find the model with the best `category_ranks` score for this query's category
4. If no category data exists, fall back to heuristic model selection (Step 3)

**4d. Self-preference penalty.**

Before finalizing model recommendations, check `model_performance.self_preference_rate` for each model. If a model's self-preference rate exceeds 20%, add a note in the routing output: `"bias_warnings": ["model X shows 23% self-preference rate — consider excluding from review rounds"]`. This doesn't auto-exclude (the user or the deliberation-engine decides), but it surfaces the signal.

## Step 5: Build Router Response

Assemble the final response object:

```json
{
  "decision": "deliberate",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "reasoning": "Query matches architecture_decision pattern — deliberation adds value 78% of the time (8 samples)",
  "routing_source": "learned",
  "uncertain": false,
  "recommended_models": [
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    "x-ai/grok-3",
    "google/gemini-2.0-flash"
  ],
  "excluded_models": [],
  "recommended_protocol": "voting",
  "estimated_cost": 0.09,
  "bias_warnings": [],
  "query_features": {
    "length": 87,
    "category": "architecture_decision",
    "keywords": ["compare", "tradeoffs"],
    "complexity_signals": {
      "sub_question_count": 2,
      "has_conditional": false,
      "has_context_reference": true,
      "has_compound_conjunction": true
    },
    "estimated_protocol": "voting"
  },
  "learning_status": "Active — 34 deliberations, 6 routing rules, last rebuilt 2026-03-28"
}
```

**Single-model response variant:**

```json
{
  "decision": "single_model",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "reasoning": "factual_lookup queries answered correctly by single model 87% of the time (5 samples)",
  "routing_source": "learned",
  "uncertain": false,
  "recommended_models": ["openai/gpt-4o"],
  "excluded_models": [],
  "recommended_protocol": null,
  "estimated_cost": 0.01,
  "bias_warnings": [],
  "query_features": { ... },
  "learning_status": "Active — 34 deliberations, 6 routing rules"
}
```

## Cost Estimation

The router estimates cost before the pipeline runs so it can enforce budget constraints:

- **Deliberation (medium):** ~$0.08-0.12 (4 models × 3 stages)
- **Deliberation (small):** ~$0.03-0.05 (2 models × 3 stages)
- **Deliberation (large):** ~$0.15-0.25 (6 models × 3 stages)
- **Single model:** ~$0.005-0.02 (1 call)

If the estimated cost exceeds the user's `--budget` setting, the router downgrades: large → medium → small → single model, until the estimate fits within budget. Log this downgrade in `reasoning`.

## Integration

The smart-router is called by the deliberation-engine **before Step 1 (Resolve Model Lineup)**. The deliberation-engine uses the router's response to:

1. Skip the full pipeline if `decision` is `single_model` (go to single-model shortcut)
2. Use `recommended_models` instead of the default lineup if provided
3. Use `recommended_protocol` to pre-select voting vs. consensus (can still be overridden by Step 3 classification)
4. Pass `query_features` through to Step 8 for pattern-memory logging
5. Display `bias_warnings` in the output if any
6. Show `learning_status` in the footer of the deliberation output

## Router Modes (configurable via /council-config)

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `learned` (default) | Full routing logic: heuristic fallback → learned rules when available |
| `always_deliberate` | Skip router entirely — every query gets full Council pipeline |
| `always_shortcut` | Skip router entirely — every query goes to single best model |

Set via: `/council-config set router learned|always_deliberate|always_shortcut`
