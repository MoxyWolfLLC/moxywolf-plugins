# Blog Content Ecosystem

## Overview

Transform a single blog post into a complete top-of-funnel (TOF) content marketing system. Generate lead magnets, bibliographies with abstracts, and multi-variant LinkedIn promotional posts—all optimized for audience engagement and lead capture.

## Workflow

This skill follows a sequential 5-step process:

1. **Analyze Blog Post** - Extract key insights, structure, and citations
2. **Create Lead Magnet** - Generate downloadable checklist, guide, or framework
3. **Generate Bibliography** - Create BibTeX entries with abstracts from sources
4. **Craft LinkedIn Posts** - Write 3 promotional post variants with CTAs
5. **Create Multimedia Assets** - Generate video/audio prompts for NotebookLM and infographic design specs

## Step 1: Analyze Blog Post

**Inputs:**
- Blog post content (markdown, text, or URL)
- Target audience information
- Blog topic/theme

**Actions:**
- Extract main themes, key statistics, and actionable insights
- Identify quotable content and data points
- Note any sources or citations that need bibliography entries
- Determine content depth (strategic/tactical, technical/accessible)

**Outputs:**
- Content analysis summary
- Key themes and hooks for promotion
- List of sources requiring bibliography entries

## Step 2: Create Lead Magnet

**Objective:** Create a high-value, immediately actionable download that extends blog insights.

**Format Options:**
- Checklist (90-day implementation roadmap, audit checklist)
- Quick reference guide (top 10 lists, comparison matrices)
- Framework document (decision trees, workflow diagrams)
- Resource compilation (tool lists, template collections)

**Lead Magnet Structure:**
```markdown
# [Compelling Title with Benefit]
## [Subtitle: Specific Outcome or Use Case]

[Brief intro paragraph - 2-3 sentences explaining value]

---

## [Section 1: Actionable Content]
- [ ] Specific action item with context
- [ ] Specific action item with context

## [Section 2: Organized by Phase/Category]
[Content structured for scanability]

## [Reference Section: Quick lookups]
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data | Data | Data |

## Red Flags / Common Mistakes
- Warning signs to watch for
- Mistakes to avoid

## About This [Asset Type]
[Brief attribution paragraph with source reference]

*Last Updated: [Date] | Based on [Blog Post Title]*
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Scannable** - Use checkboxes, tables, bullet points
- **Actionable** - Every item should be a concrete next step
- **Comprehensive** - Cover 80% of common use cases
- **Professional** - Clean formatting, clear hierarchy
- **Branded** - Include attribution to source blog/author

**See:** `references/lead-magnet-examples.md` for complete examples

## Step 3: Generate Bibliography with Abstracts

**Objective:** Create a properly formatted BibTeX bibliography where each entry includes a substantive abstract summarizing the source's contribution.

**Process:**

### 3a. Extract Citation Information

From the blog post, identify all sources:
- Direct quotes with URLs
- Referenced statistics or data
- Frameworks or methodologies mentioned
- Industry reports or studies cited

### 3b. Fetch Source Content

For each source with a URL:
- Use web_search or web_fetch to retrieve content
- Extract key information: title, author/organization, publication date, URL/DOI
- Read enough to understand the source's main contribution

### 3c. Write Abstracts

**Abstract Quality Standards:**
- **Length:** 2-4 sentences (50-150 words)
- **Content:** Summarize the source's main argument, findings, or contribution
- **Specificity:** Include specific data points, methodologies, or claims when relevant
- **Relevance:** Explain why this source matters to the blog topic
- **Neutrality:** Objective summary, not evaluation

**Good Abstract Example:**
```
abstract = {Analysis of CMMC compliance costs and automation strategies 
for Defense Industrial Base contractors. Examines how STIG automation 
through ConfigOS reduces implementation time from months to hours, 
addresses the challenge of quarterly STIG updates (every 90 days), and 
provides cost estimates ranging from $2,999.56 for Level 1 to $51,095.60 
for Level 2+ compliance with $41,666 in recurring engineering costs.}
```

**Poor Abstract Example:**
```
abstract = {This article discusses CMMC and automation.}
```

### 3d. Format BibTeX Entries

**Entry Template:**
```bibtex
@misc{citationkey2025,
  author = {{Organization Name}},
  title = {Full Article Title},
  year = {2025},
  month = {January},
  url = {https://example.com/article},
  note = {Accessed January 2026},
  abstract = {2-4 sentence summary of the source's contribution, 
  including specific data points, findings, or arguments that make 
  this source valuable. Explains relevance to the topic.}
}
```

**Citation Key Format:** `authorlastname` or `organization` + `year` + optional descriptor
- Examples: `steelcloud2025cmmc`, `nist800171`, `mack2026stig`

**Entry Types:**
- `@misc` - Blog posts, web articles, company pages
- `@techreport` - Government reports, technical documents
- `@article` - Journal articles (include journal, volume, pages if available)

**Output:** Save as `[topic]_bibliography_with_abstracts.bib`

## Step 4: Craft LinkedIn Posts

**Objective:** Create 3 distinct post variants targeting different engagement styles, all driving traffic to the blog with clear CTAs.

**Three Variants:**

### Variant 1: Direct/Urgent Tone
- **Hook:** Recent event, deadline, or breaking development
- **Length:** 1,300-1,500 characters
- **Structure:** 
  - Urgent opening (3 months ago X, today Y)
  - Brutal reality (3-5 data points with →)
  - Competitive advantage angle
  - Strong CTA with reason to act now

### Variant 2: Insight/Strategy Tone
- **Hook:** Contrarian insight or hidden pattern
- **Length:** 1,300-1,500 characters
- **Structure:**
  - Pattern observation opening
  - Strategic framework explanation
  - Concrete example comparison (❌ weak vs ✅ strong)
  - CTA with strategic benefit

### Variant 3: Personal/Narrative Tone
- **Hook:** Personal experience or observation
- **Length:** 1,300-1,500 characters
- **Structure:**
  - Personal credibility opening
  - Specific inflection point or change
  - "And here's what almost everyone is missing"
  - CTA with personal endorsement

**Universal Requirements:**
- **Formatting:** Use line breaks, bullets (→), bold sparingly
- **CTAs:** Always include both blog link and lead magnet download link
- **Hashtags:** 4-6 relevant hashtags at end
- **Value-first:** 80% value, 20% promotion
- **Authentic voice:** Match the author's style and expertise

**CTA Format:**
```

## Step 5: Create Multimedia Assets

**Objective:** Generate NotebookLM prompts for video/audio content and design specifications for infographic, all optimized for the target audience.

### Target Audience (STIGViewer ICP)

**Primary Personas:**
- Compliance professionals tracking quarterly STIG updates
- Defense contractors (DIB) requiring CMMC certification
- System administrators implementing STIGs on infrastructure
- CISOs/security leaders managing strategic compliance
- IT security teams handling day-to-day STIG deployments

**Audience Characteristics:**
- **Technical sophistication:** HIGH - expect technical depth, not marketing fluff
- **Weekly engagement:** 35,000+ regular visitors
- **Content consumption:** Practical, actionable, data-driven focus
- **Pain points:** Quarterly update tracking, multi-STIG management, audit preparation
- **Time sensitivity:** Updates and deadlines matter significantly

### 5a. Video Content (5-10 Minutes)

**Format:** NotebookLM AI-generated video discussion

**Objective:** Create an engaging conversation between two cybersecurity compliance experts that drives interest in both the blog post and lead magnet.

**Pronunciation Guide (CRITICAL):**
- **STIG** = "stig" (rhymes with "pig")
- **DISA** = "dissah" (DISS-ah, not DEE-sah)
- **CMMC** = "C-M-M-C" (spell out each letter)

**Three-Act Structure:**

**Act 1: The Wake-Up Call (0-3 min)**
- Open with the enforcement date or inflection point
- "Why didn't we see this coming when [X] has been around for [Y] years?"
- Reveal the hidden dependency/connection
- Set up the "brutal reality" with 2-3 data points

**Act 2: The Technical Reality (3-7 min)**
- Deep dive on the core technical challenge
- Walk through the math that makes manual approaches untenable
- Discuss cost-benefit with specific numbers
- Explain the strategic concept (compliance multiplier, etc.)
- Include a debate moment where hosts push back on assumptions

**Act 3: The Strategic Play (7-10 min)**
- Timeline urgency with specific dates
- Who wins/loses in this environment
- Competitive advantage reframing
- Practical next steps (mention the checklist)
- Closing insight that reframes the challenge as opportunity

**Discussion Angle Guidance:**

*Primary Focus (60% of time):*
- The "hidden in plain sight" revelation - why this connection wasn't obvious before
- The automation imperative - math that proves manual is dead
- Timeline urgency - specific dates and preparation windows

*Secondary Focus (30% of time):*
- Strategic implications - who benefits, market consolidation effects
- The multiplier effect - how one investment satisfies multiple requirements
- Real cost analysis - move beyond estimates to actual ROI calculations

*Engagement Moments (10% of time):*
- Debate point where hosts disagree, then resolve
- "Let's do the math together" moment
- Analogies that make technical concepts accessible
- Recognition beats ("Oh, that's why audits have been painful")

**Emotional Arc:**
- Minute 0-2: Recognition/Validation ("This explains so much")
- Minute 3-5: Overwhelm ("This seems impossible manually")
- Minute 5-7: Hope ("But automation makes it feasible")
- Minute 7-9: Urgency ("We need to start now")
- Minute 9-10: Empowerment ("Here's the exact roadmap")

**Key Quotes to Reference:**
[Include 3-5 most impactful quotes from blog post]

**Closing CTA:**
- Mention the 90-day implementation checklist
- Direct to blog for full analysis
- Position as immediate actionable resource

**See:** `references/multimedia-asset-guide.md` for complete video prompt templates

### 5b. Audio Content (1.5 Minutes)

**Format:** NotebookLM AI-generated audio-only discussion

**Objective:** Create a concise, high-impact summary perfect for commutes or quick consumption.

**Pronunciation Guide:** Same as video (STIG = "stig", DISA = "dissah")

**Ultra-Condensed Structure:**

**Opening (0-15 sec):**
- Hook: The single most important development or data point
- Example: "On November 10, 2025, the DoD made CMMC 2.0 mandatory for 338,000 defense contractors. Most are discovering the secret to passing audits too late."

**Core Insight (15-60 sec):**
- The one thing listeners must understand
- The brutal reality in 2-3 bullet points with data
- Why this matters RIGHT NOW

**Action (60-75 sec):**
- What listeners should do immediately
- Mention the lead magnet as the starting point
- Create FOMO without being salesy

**Closing (75-90 sec):**
- Single memorable quote or reframe
- Direct to blog for full details
- End with urgency

**Tone:** Direct, data-driven, no filler. Every sentence must earn its place.

**Key Principle:** Audio-only listeners can't reference visuals, so use verbal signposting:
- "Here's the critical stat..."
- "Three things matter..."
- "The timeline looks like this..."

### 5c. Infographic Design
