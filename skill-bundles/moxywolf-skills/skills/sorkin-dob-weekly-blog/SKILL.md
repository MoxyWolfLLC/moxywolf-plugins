# Sorkin DOB Weekly Blog

## Overview

Transform Dorian's weekly STIG+CMMC2 research into compelling narrative blogs that apply Aaron Sorkin's Desire-Obstacle-Battle (DOB) storytelling framework with MoxyWolf's brand voice.

**Sorkin's DOB Framework:**
- **Desire**: What the character wants (win contracts, prove security, sustain trust)
- **Obstacle**: What stands in their way (regulatory complexity, scale problems, technical barriers)
- **Battle**: The conflict when desire meets obstacle (the struggle playing out in the ecosystem)

**This skill transforms**: "Here's what changed" → "Here's what you're fighting for, what's blocking you, and the battle you're in"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Research Structure

Dorian's research typically arrives as:
- Five-act narrative already outlined
- Bracketed citation numbers [1][2][3]
- Source list at end with URLs
- Act-based headers describing story beats

**Identify DOB elements:**
- Acts I-II = Desire and emerging obstacle
- Acts II-III = Obstacle becomes urgent
- Acts IV-V = Battle intensifies toward new paradigm (don't resolve it)

### Step 2: Apply MoxyWolf Voice

Transform analytical prose into human-authentic voice using these **mandatory elements**:

**Voice Requirements:**
- Use contractions in 80%+ of opportunities ("doesn't," "can't," "it's")
- Vary sentence length aggressively (4-word fragments to 40-word buildups)
- Use fragments deliberately for emphasis
- Start sentences with And, But, Or
- Break topic-sentence patterns
- Replace abstract claims with specific, visceral details
- Always use typographer's quotes: "curly" not "straight"
- Use spaced en-dashes " – " sparingly, never em dashes (—)

**Forbidden Phrases** (AI tells - never use):
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "It's important to understand..."
- "In today's rapidly changing..."
- "At its core..."
- "Moving forward..."
- "In order to..." (use "to")
- "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Moreover" (use And, or delete)

### Step 3: Sharpen Character Stakes

Transform observations into visceral experience.

❌ Avoid: "Contractors faced challenges with manual evidence collection."

✅ Use: "Picture a CISO three weeks before audit, staring at 320 controls and a spreadsheet that hasn't updated since June. The POA&M they submitted six months ago? Already obsolete. The assessor arrives in 18 days."

**Technique**: Use second-person perspective or specific scenarios that put readers inside the experience.

### Step 4: Embed Citations Invisibly

Transform bracketed citations into natural narrative authority with proper in-text citations.

❌ Avoid: "Articles argue automation is 'the only scalable path'.[11]"

✅ Use: "Fortra (2026) isn't being subtle about it: automation is 'the only scalable path' to CMMC Level 2. Manual evidence collection can't scale to 220,000 contractors racing toward the same certification deadline."

**Citation Format:**
Use (Author/Organization, Year) format integrated naturally into prose:
- "Steel Patriot Partners (2024) describes STIGs as..."
- "According to the Federal Register (2024), CMMC 2.0 requires..."
- "DoD's audit (Wiley Law, 2024) flagged weaknesses..."
- "Companies like Accorian (2024) and Integris IT (2024) have been blunt..."

**Technique:**
- Always include (Author/Organization, Year) for factual claims
- Weave citations into sentence structure naturally
- Place citation after the entity name or at end of claim
- Use direct quotes only when exact phrasing matters (keep under 15 words for copyright compliance)
- Include full source list at end with titles and URLs

See `references/examples.md` for detailed before/after transformations.

### Step 5: Structure Narrative Arc

**Opening** (Desire established):
- Show world before the shift
- What everyone wants
- 2-3 paragraphs maximum
- End with emerging tension

**Rising Action** (Obstacle emerges):
- Old methods stop working
- Stakes become urgent
- Show pressure building
- Use concrete examples and numbers

**Battle Intensifies** (Confrontation):
- Ecosystem reorganizes itself
- New solutions emerge but fight isn't over
- Show both promise and remaining challenges

**Ending** (Unresolved tension):
- DO NOT resolve cleanly
- Leave readers mid-battle with choice to make
- Frame ongoing struggle
- End with dramatic tension

❌ Avoid: "Organizations that adopt automation will succeed."
✅ Use: "The question isn't whether automation wins. It's whether your organization figures that out before your competitor does – and before DoD makes the decision for you."

### Step 6: Polish for Human Authenticity

Run anti-AI detection checklist:

- [ ] Contractions used in 80%+ of opportunities
- [ ] No forbidden phrases
- [ ] No formulaic transitions (Furthermore, Additionally, Moreover)
- [ ] Sentence length varies dramatically (4-word and 40-word sentences present)
- [ ] At least one fragment per section
- [ ] Parallelism broken (not everything in threes)
- [ ] Specific examples replace abstract claims
- [ ] Paragraphs vary in length (including single-sentence paragraphs)
- [ ] Sentences start with And, But, or Or in each section
- [ ] No topic-sentence pattern for 3+ consecutive paragraphs
- [ ] Typographer's quotes throughout
- [ ] Spaced en-dashes only, no em dashes

## Output Format

### Blog Post Structure

```markdown
# [Stakes-Driven Headline]

[Opening hook – 2-3 paragraphs establishing desire and tension]

## [Thematic section break - not "Act I"]

[Rising action – obstacle becomes clear]

## [Thematic section break]

[Battle intensifies – ecosystem shifts]

[Ending – unresolved tension, dramatic question]

**Sources**

[Full citation list with titles and URLs]
```

**DO NOT** use "Act I, Act II" headers in published blog.
**DO NOT** include bracketed citation numbers in body text.
**DO** include complete source list at end with descriptive titles and full URLs.

### Headline Formula

Capture DOB tension in headline:

❌ Avoid: "CMMC 2.0 Updates for 2026"
❌ Avoid: "How STIG Automation Helps CMMC Compliance"

✅ Use: "The Audit That Outgrew the Checklist: When Paperwork Stopped Being Enough"
✅ Use: "From Passing Audits to Proving Trust: The STIG Automation Reckoning"
✅ Use: "220,000 Contractors, 200 Assessors, One Deadline: Why Manual Evidence Just Died"

**Formula**: [Vivid situation] + [Stakes/tension] or [Old world] vs [New reality]

## Execution Checklist

Before delivery, verify:

**Structure:**
- [ ] Clear DOB arc (desire → obstacle → battle)
- [ ] Opens with visceral hook, not abstract overview
- [ ] Builds tension through middle
- [ ] Ends with unresolved dramatic question
- [ ] No "Act I/II/III" headers in final version
- [ ] Thematic section breaks flow naturally

**Voice:**
- [ ] MoxyWolf brand voice throughout
- [ ] 80%+ contractions
- [ ] No AI tell phrases
- [ ] Sentence length varies dramatically
- [ ] Specific examples, not abstract claims
- [ ] Fragments used deliberately
- [ ] Typographer's quotes throughout

**Citations:**
- [ ] No bracketed numbers in body text
- [ ] In-text citations use (Author/Organization, Year) format
- [ ] Every factual claim has proper citation
- [ ] Citations woven naturally into prose (not interrupting flow)
- [ ] Direct quotes under 15 words (copyright compliance)
- [ ] Full source list at end with titles and URLs
- [ ] Attributions feel organic to narrative

**Impact:**
- [ ] Stakes are visceral and immediate
- [ ] Reader can feel pressure/tension
- [ ] Technical audience respects precision
- [ ] Ending leaves them mid-battle with decision
- [ ] Could be read aloud and sound natural

## Common Pitfalls

**❌ Leaving citations as [1][2][3]**: Transform into natural attributions

**❌ Resolving the tension**: Sorkin doesn't wrap neatly. Neither should you. Leave readers mid-battle.

**❌ Using AI transitions**: "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Moreover" are tells. Use And, But, or delete.

**❌ Abstract language**: "Organizations face challenges" → "You're the CISO staring at 320 controls and 18 days until audit"

**❌ Topic sentences everywhere**: Break the pattern. Build to points. Bury them. Mix it up.

**❌ Clean parallelism**: Make one item longer, one shorter, one a fragment

**❌ Hedging**: "This might potentially help" → "This changes everything"

**❌ Neat endings**: Don't end with resolution. End with "The question is whether you figure it out before your competitor does."

## Resources

## Success Criteria

A successful transformation:
1. Feels like a story, not a report
2. Puts reader in scene with visceral, specific details
